                <div class="history-content">
                    <p>The Ascent Group was founded on a simple yet powerful principle: organizations thrive when their people strategy is clear, intentional, and aligned with their purpose. Too many companies struggle with fragmented HR practices, compliance challenges, and misaligned talent strategies that hinder growth.</p>
                    <p>Our founders recognized that businesses needed a partner who could provide both strategic vision and practical execution—someone who understands the complexities of modern HR while remaining focused on what truly matters: creating workplaces where people can do their best work.</p>
                    <p>What makes our approach unique is our commitment to understanding your organization's specific context, culture, and goals. We don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we work collaboratively with you to design HR strategies that are as unique as your business, ensuring that every recommendation is practical, actionable, and aligned with your long-term vision.</p>
                    <p>Today, we combine decades of collective experience in human resources, organizational development, and business strategy to deliver solutions that don't just solve immediate problems, but build lasting capabilities within your organization.</p>
